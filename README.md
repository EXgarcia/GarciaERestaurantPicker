Challenge "Restaurant Picker"
In this project we will create a list of restaurants and reandomly return one to the user depending on the category they choose.

Review: Brandon Le - Overall very good project. Some things that stood out to me were the cute design aspects with the special characters. Very fun and creative idea. The randomizer worked properly and gave different options to the user when you chose the corresponding category. For the play again/end function - it would have been nice to have the user enter in specific phrases to restart or end but I tried typing a 3 at the part where you can end the program, and it took me to the beginning, so that kind of doesn't make sense? So a phrase like yes to play again or restart etc would be cool. Other than that it worked properly and gave me a random place to eat at. Good job. Cute designs. Clean code.
